# smartSQLite
 
smartSQLite is a small resource-saving SQLite editor with auto-completion, syntax highlighting and much more.


## Description

smartSQLite Editor is a compact SQLite editor for the experienced Pro user.
It is programmed to make your work easier and allows you to edit your database visually according to the command principle.
We believe in the command principle and do not use a query builder, instead we use intelligent auto-completion for commands, tables and column names.

smartSQLite editor includes several functions among them:

Automatic code and column titles and table names completion.

Executing SQLite commands in a script saved as a txt file or in our file format.

Import and export CSV files.

SQLite script templates.

Direct lookup of the create command to an existing table or database

SQLite interpreter window

Sorting and searching

Print.

We continue to extend the functions and possibilities of the smartSQLite editor.
